# Win10-NewBuild
A powershell script to automate the install and setup of programs, firewall rules, group policies etc I use as a base build for Windows 10 VM's

List of scripts to create

* [X] Install Firefox
* [ ] Install Firefox Addons
  * Privacy Badger

  * uBlock Origin
 * [ ] Pin/remove programs to the taskbar
 * [ ] Change windows update settings to include drivers
 * [ ] Change group policies to a standardised list
 * [ ] Run Windows Update
 * [ ] Update Windows Defender
 * [ ] Add / Remove firewall rules from a standardised list
 * [ ] Disable telemetry
 * [ ] Install programs from predownloaded install files once install files are detected
 
 * [ ] Amalgamate all the above into one script once all are tested.
